    <!-- A few sentences about a trip -->
    <p>This summer, I took my first trip to Disney World in Orlando. Stepping into the park, I felt like entering a world of magic and my childhood nostalgia. It made me feel like a kid again.</p>

            My favorite food is Zereshk Polo. In English, it can be translated as Barberry Rice with chicken. I like it to be served with Shirazi salad.
            This dish is a staple in Persian cuisine, known for its unique combination of tangy barberries and savory chicken, all served on a bed of fluffy saffron rice.
